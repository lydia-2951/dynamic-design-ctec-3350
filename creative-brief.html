            <h2>Project Background</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Client:</b> Mansfield Gardens</li>
                <li><b>Product/Service:</b> Flowers, indoor and outdoor plants, trees, shrubs, landscaping design and installation, gardening supplies, local honey, fresh produce, pottery and garden d√©cor</li>
                <li><b>SWOT:</b> <a href="analysis.html">SWOT Analysis</a></li>
                <li><b>Existing Research:</b> Currently there is no existing research available.</li>
                <li><b>Date:</b> February 13, 2022</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Project type:</b>  Website Redesign</li>
                <li><b>Reason for project:</b> Mansfield Gardens would like to increase the number of people visiting its store by letting website users know why they should come and how to get there. Mansfield Gardens also seeks to appeal to a new target audience (the millennial generation), to be ahead of the trend of returning to in-person work, and to gain new clientele in the form of other businesses.</li>
                <li><b>Opportunities:</b> People who have been working from home are returning to offices. If they have been used to having plants around them at home, they will likely want to start looking for office plants as well. In a similar vein, Mansfield Gardens would also like to take advantage of the current low-light/indoor plant trend.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Drivers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Goals:</b> Our primary goals for this project are to help Mansfield Gardens update its overall online branding and marketing; to increase interest from potential customers (individuals and businesses); to promote the effort of Mansfield Gardens to educate customers on plant care; and to encourage long-lasting and trusting relationships between Mansfield Gardens and its current and potential customers.
                <li><b>Top Three Objectives:</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Recruit 30 members for a new loyalty program with an informative sign-up page on the website.</li> 
                        <li>Increase daily foot traffic at Mansfield Gardens by 30% through the website, to be measured by use of an online exclusive coupon.</li>
                        <li>Serve 3 businesses with a new office plant care service promoted on the website.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><b>Project length:</b>  Approximately 3 months</li>
                <li><b>Length of time until goal is achieved:</b> Approximately 6-12 months following the completion of the project</li>
            </ul>
